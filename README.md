# Build-a-Light-Bright-App

This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "Legacy Data Visualization" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can click or drag the mouse cursor to color the circles.

User Story: I can double-click on a colored circle to remove the color.

User Story: I can click on a colored circle to change its color.

User Story: I should get a circle of different color on each click.
